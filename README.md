# Portfolio-AWY

## Purpose  
The end purpose of this project is to display my projects and skills to potential employers.
However, this is just the begining of the process and this project serves as a learning tool for me to apply what I have learned in class. It also forces me to learn the technical aspects we don't learn in class, like screenshots for my readme file. I am also still unable to display photos and gifs on my github deployed site because I lack the knowledge or am unable to get the process to work like I need.

### Pros
The project did allow me to get a better grasp on css. I had a tough time with the project, and wasn't able to acheive the results I wanted, but the site looks much better from where I started. My commmits should give some history to my learning process. I tired several methods before I found something that worked after several days of suffering.
